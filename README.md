The gym chain One Fitness is in the process of developing a customer interaction strategy driven by analytical data. One of the most significant challenges that gyms and similar services encounter is customer churn. But how can you determine if a customer has disengaged? You can calculate churn by tracking those who cancel their accounts or fail to renew their memberships. However, sometimes it’s not immediately clear that a client has left; they may quietly withdraw their engagement.

Churn indicators can differ across industries. For example, if a customer rarely makes a purchase from an online store but does so consistently, they cannot be considered lost. Conversely, if a user has not accessed a platform that offers daily updates for two weeks, that’s a cause for concern; they may have lost interest and moved on.

For a gym, it is reasonable to conclude that a customer has left if they haven’t visited in a month. While it’s possible they are on vacation and will return, this is not the usual scenario. Typically, if a customer joins, attends a few times, and then disappears, they are unlikely to return.

To combat churn, Model Fitness has digitized several customer profiles. Your task is to analyze this data and develop a customer retention strategy.

You should:
 - Learn to predict the probability of churn (for the upcoming month) for each customer
 - Draw up typical user portraits: select the most outstanding groups and describe their main features
 - Analyze the factors that impact churn most
 - Draw basic conclusions and develop recommendations on how to improve customer service:
   
      - Identify target groups
   
      - Suggest measures to cut churn
   
      - Describe any other patterns you see with respect to interaction with customers
